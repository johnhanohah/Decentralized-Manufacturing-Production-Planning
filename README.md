## Smart Contracts

### 1. Production Manager Verification (\`production-manager-verification.clar\`)
Manages the verification and authorization of production managers.

**Key Functions:**
- \`verify-manager\`: Add a new verified production manager
- \`revoke-manager\`: Remove manager verification
- \`is-verified-manager\`: Check if a manager is verified
- \`get-manager-details\`: Retrieve manager information

### 2. Demand Forecasting (\`demand-forecasting.clar\`)
Handles production demand forecasting and historical tracking.

**Key Functions:**
- \`create-forecast\`: Create a new demand forecast
- \`update-forecast\`: Update existing forecast
- \`get-demand-forecast\`: Retrieve forecast data
- \`get-product-history\`: Get historical demand data

### 3. Capacity Planning (\`capacity-planning.clar\`)
Manages production facility capacity and utilization.

**Key Functions:**
- \`register-facility\`: Register a new production facility
- \`set-capacity\`: Set facility capacity for a period
- \`allocate-capacity\`: Allocate capacity to production
- \`calculate-utilization-rate\`: Calculate capacity utilization

### 4. Schedule Optimization (\`schedule-optimization.clar\`)
Optimizes production schedules and manages conflicts.

**Key Functions:**
- \`create-schedule\`: Create a new production schedule
- \`update-schedule-status\`: Update schedule status
- \`optimize-schedule\`: Optimize facility schedules
- \`get-conflicts\`: Retrieve schedule conflicts

### 5. Resource Allocation (\`resource-allocation.clar\`)
Manages production resource inventory and allocation.

**Key Functions:**
- \`add-resource\`: Add resources to inventory
- \`allocate-resource\`: Allocate resources to production
- \`release-resource\`: Release allocated resources
- \`calculate-resource-utilization\`: Calculate resource utilization

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- production-manager-verification.test.js

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
\`\`\`

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with separate contracts for each major function:

1. **Manager Verification**: Ensures only authorized personnel can make critical decisions
2. **Demand Forecasting**: Provides data-driven production planning
3. **Capacity Planning**: Optimizes facility utilization
4. **Schedule Optimization**: Minimizes conflicts and maximizes efficiency
5. **Resource Allocation**: Ensures optimal resource utilization

## Security Considerations

- All critical functions require proper authorization
- Input validation on all public functions
- Overflow protection on arithmetic operations
- Access control for sensitive operations
